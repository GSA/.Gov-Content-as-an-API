## Background 

Agencies increasingly see the content of their website as a critical component of the information that they provide to the public.  Enabling a content API brings the benefits of APIs to this major agency dataset.  This process is outlined below and is available [as a service of 18F](http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/agency_support).  

Note that the below process is currently available to any federal agency website based on Wordpress or Drupal.  These open source platforms have allowed for the turnkey solutions that make this process possible.  

### Step 1 
Coordinate with IT to activate the Content API module in staging.  

### Step 2 
Test the content API in staging.  Confirm that it works and that the site continues to operate smoothly.  

### Step 3 
Coordinate with IT to activate the Content API module in production.  

### Step 4 
Once the module is live in production, confirm that it works and that the site continues to operate smoothly.  At this point, the API is still unannounced and quietly operating unobserved.  

### Step 5
Modify the template API documentation to suit the specifics of the agency website.  Test specific API queries.  

### Step 6 
Publish the API documentation and it at leisure.
