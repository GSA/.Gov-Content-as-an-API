## Email to Agencies

Hi,  

[ Intro ]

Recently, some agencies have done some good work building content APIs for open source CMS.  








Benefits - 
* Getting an API for no effort 
* DGS and Open Data Policy are pressuring agencies to offer more APIs - this helps that.  
* [ If they don't have one, this is easy and fast way to get started ] 
* If they are a digitalgov search customer, 
* Allows for easier prototyping and building of widgets, apps, and mobile pages.  





Process - 
* Test module in Staging.  Confirm that api is working in staging.
* Activate module in production.
